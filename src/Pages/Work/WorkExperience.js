        projectDescription: 'At Square, I worked on the Customers Marketing Team, whose goal is to strengthen the relationship between Square sellers and their customers through email, SMS, and receipt campaigns. I helped improve the appearance and scalability of the first page in the web flow to create an email campaign, which is the entry point to Square Marketing for every Square seller. As part of this project, I worked alongside another full-time employee to conduct an A/B/C test to determine the UX experience that would best increase engagement and usage of this email campaign creation flow.',
